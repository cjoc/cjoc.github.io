      <description>The Challenge Every year, Downing College JCR (junior common room) has to allocate rooms to all students in college. This is done by means of a random ballot, whose function will be explained in greater detail below. The JCR must also decide the price of each room in College.
After being one of the ballot&amp;rsquo;s victims the first time &amp;lsquo;round, and seeing how inefficient the current system was, I decided that a better solution was needed.</description>

      <description>The Challenge Downing College is widely known as Cambridge&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Law College&amp;rdquo;, with more law students than almost any other college, and a number of high-profile law fellows. Downing has its own law society, named Cranworth, which organises talks and helps students find success in their careers.
The society president wanted a website to serve as a repository for important information and recruitment data, with access restricted to only the society&amp;rsquo;s members.</description>
